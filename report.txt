This assignment involved creating a C++ program to manage animal data for a zoo, utilizing object-oriented programming principles and data structures like vectors and maps. I designed an Animal class to store common attributes, such as name, age, and species, and used a vector to store animal instances and a map to count species. While I simplified the program by hardcoding input data instead of reading from a file, I successfully implemented file output to generate a report with animal details and species counts. This project helped me practice key C++ concepts, including control structures, encapsulation, and basic file I/O, while reinforcing my understanding of object-oriented design.
